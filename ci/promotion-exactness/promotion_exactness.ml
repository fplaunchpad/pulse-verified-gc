(* End-to-end detection of the allocator's one-word-leftover bug (issue #19),
 * through the promotion path.
 *
 *   usage: ocamlrun ./promotion_exactness.byte <major-heap-words> [fill]
 *   with MIN_EXPANSION_WORDSIZE set to the same word count.
 *
 * THE BUG. When a free block is exactly one word longer than the request, the
 * pre-fix allocator hands the whole block over and writes the header with the
 * BLOCK's wosize instead of the requested one (GC_Gen_Impl.c, the
 * `leftover >= 2` else-branch: `makeHeader(block_wz, white, 0)`).
 *
 * WHY THIS GOES THROUGH PROMOTION. On the direct major path the lie never
 * reaches the object: caml_alloc_shr_aux overwrites the header with the
 * requested wosize as soon as verified_allocate returns. Promotion does not.
 * The minor->major copy reads the header the allocator wrote and rebuilds it
 * verbatim -- `wz_read = getWosize(major_hdr); makeHeader(wz_read, White, tag)`
 * -- so the promoted object declares one field more than was copied into it.
 *
 * WHY THE CHECK IS AN ASSERTION, NOT A CRASH. Because that inflated header is
 * the object's own header, Array.length reads it directly. We do not have to
 * wait for something to follow the phantom field and fault, which is what
 * makes tests/ast-invariants an unreliable detector: whether it segfaults
 * depends on the platform (it fails 100% on Fedora 44 / gcc 16 and passes 15/15
 * on ubuntu-latest, with the allocator provably broken in both). An inflated
 * length is the defect itself rather than one of its possible symptoms.
 *
 * GETTING THE ALLOCATOR TO TAKE THAT BRANCH is the whole difficulty, and two
 * things have to be arranged:
 *
 *   - The free list must be out of tail. Coalesce walks upward making each
 *     flushed block the new head, so the head is the highest-address free
 *     block -- the unallocated tail -- and first fit serves every request from
 *     it with a large leftover, never touching a fragment. So the heap is
 *     filled to `fill` first.
 *   - The collection has to actually happen. `Gc.full_major ()` does NOT drive
 *     this collector: caml_gc_full_major calls stock caml_finish_major_cycle.
 *     The verified mark/sweep/coalesce is reachable from the promotion
 *     threshold, from a failed major allocation, or from the
 *     caml_trigger_verified_gc primitive -- which is what this uses. Without
 *     it the victims below are never swept and no fragments ever exist.
 *
 * Then: build alternating [victim wosize V][keeper] pairs in ONE array so
 * Cheney copies them in index order and they interleave; drop every victim and
 * sweep, leaving wosize-V blocks each pinned between two survivors so coalesce
 * cannot merge them; then promote objects of wosize V-1. Once the tail is
 * gone, every request lands on a wosize-V fragment, leftover is 1, and the
 * header is inflated.
 *
 * Deterministic: no randomness, no timing dependence. Identical counts run to
 * run on a given (heap, fill).
