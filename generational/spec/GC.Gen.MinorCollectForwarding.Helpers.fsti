///
/// This module captures the reusable forwarding kernel of the upstream
/// minor-collection isomorphism proof, specialized to the current
/// `minor_collect_full` path.
///
/// The property is intentionally stated over `cheney_collect_spec`, since the
/// Pulse implementation proves its concrete two-pass update equals that spec.
/// The source roots are the program roots plus the remembered-set slot targets;
/// when those remembered targets are represented in the root array and the
/// collector returns `ok`, the forwarding map is an injective morphism for
/// reachable minor objects and all images are valid post-minor addresses
/// (ordinary objects or infix interior pointers).  This is NOT, by itself, a
/// graph isomorphism: the full reachable-subgraph isomorphism additionally
/// proves surjectivity onto the post-minor reachable subgraph and edge
/// preservation/reflection.  The result-indexed wrapper states that theorem
/// directly over the heap and roots returned by `minor_collect_full`.
