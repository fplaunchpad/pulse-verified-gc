(*
   The heap, counted.

   Right-justified allocation can leave a one-word remainder that is free but
   cannot be linked: a block of wosize 0 has no field to hold a free-list
   pointer (`GC.Spec.Allocator.alloc_from_block`, the `leftover = 1` arm).
   `GC.Spec.FreeList.linkable_heap` used to assert that no such object exists.
   It has since been deleted: the `wosize >= 1` bound it really supplied now
   lives in `fl_sound`, where it is true, because it is a property of chain
   cells rather than of every object.

   This module states the true version. Every object of the walk falls into
   exactly one class, and the classes sum to the space the walk covers:

       total = allocated + linkable-free + fragments + in-flight

   so a fragment is not lost, it is *counted*. The word the allocator cannot
   link is still in the total; it has merely moved out of the free-list class.

   Counting is in whsize -- header plus fields, stock OCaml's Whsize_wosize
   (runtime/caml/mlvalues.h:165) -- and that is forced, not stylistic. Splitting
   one block into two preserves the whsize sum but *drops* the wosize sum by
   one, because a second header appears. A conservation law in wosize would be
   false of the very operation we want to reason about.
