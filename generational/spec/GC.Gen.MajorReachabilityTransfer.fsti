module GC.Gen.MajorReachabilityTransfer

/// Transferring reachability across the major collection.
///
/// The major collector's caller-facing contract
/// (`GC.Spec.Correctness.major_gc_live_subgraph_isomorphism`) relates the heap
/// before marking to the heap after coalescing.  Composing it with the minor
/// collector's isomorphism requires moving reachability *in both directions*
/// between the two heaps, which the edge clause alone cannot do: it is guarded
/// on both endpoints already being live, so the natural path induction is
/// circular.  The successor clause is what breaks the circularity, and this
/// module turns it into the two transfer lemmas the composition needs.
///
/// The graph-level statements are generic: two graphs that agree on the
/// successor lists of a successor-closed vertex set have the same reachability
/// and the same edges inside that set.
