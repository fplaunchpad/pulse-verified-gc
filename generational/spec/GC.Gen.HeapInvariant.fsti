/// Major-heap shape needed by both minor collection and the following major GC:
/// object layout/infix well-formedness, free-list validity, color invariants,
/// and the no-pointer-to-blue safety condition.
///
/// A *no-scan* object (`tag >= 251`: a string, `Bytes.t`, `Bigarray` payload or
/// custom block) may hold arbitrary bytes, including words that spell a
/// perfectly well-formed heap address.  Parts 2 and 3 of `well_formed_heap` are
/// guarded by `GC.Spec.Fields.fields_constrained`, so nothing is demanded of
/// those words -- matching the extracted collector, which never reads them, and
/// `GC.Spec.HeapGraph.get_pointer_fields`, which returns `Seq.empty` for such an
/// object.  `GC.SPOT.NoScanMajor` exhibits a heap that satisfies this shape and
/// would have been rejected before, so the relaxation is not vacuous.
///
/// The relaxation costs one clause.  `GC.Gen.Promote.blue_fields_closed` used to
/// follow from part 2 alone; a *blue* no-scan block is now unconstrained, so it
/// no longer does, and `major_heap_shape` carries `blue_fields_closed major`
/// outright.  That is not a strengthening --- it was derivable before --- and it
/// is re-established after a major collection by
/// `GC.Gen.PostCollectionShape.coalesce_blue_fields_closed`, which reads
/// `GC.Spec.Fields.blue_blocks_scannable` off `GC.Spec.Coalesce.
/// coalesce_blue_blocks_scannable`: coalescing gives every free block a fresh
/// tag-0 header, so a blue no-scan block exists only transiently between sweep
/// and coalesce.
///
/// Interior (infix) pointers in *live* major fields are allowed.  A white, gray
/// or black object may hold a pointer into the middle of a closure, which is how
/// OCaml represents mutually recursive functions; parts 2 and 3 of
/// `well_formed_heap` are stated on the resolved target and
/// `GC.Gen.CombinedGraph.classify_major_field` resolves, so such an edge is
/// carried by the combined graph rather than silently dropped.
///
/// The one place interior pointers are still ruled out is `blue_fields_non_infix`:
/// a *free-list cell* may not hold one.  That is not a statement about the
/// mutator's data; it is what makes `GC.Gen.Promote.blue_fields_closed` --- which
/// is stated on the raw field value --- derivable from the resolved part 2, via
/// `GC.Gen.PromoteUpdate.BlueAlloc.wfh_part2_implies_blue_fields_closed`.
///
/// How it is established.  It is *not* automatic, and it would be false if the
/// collector simply threaded dead blocks onto the free list: a dying object may
/// hold interior pointers, and `GC.Spec.Sweep.sweep_object` rewrites only its
/// link word, leaving the rest of the corpse intact.  What makes it true is that
/// the coalescing pass **zeroes** every field of a merged free block above the
/// link (`Alloc.zero_fields` in `GC.Spec.Coalesce.flush_blue`, extracted as
/// `zero_fields_loop`), so a blue cell's one pointer-shaped field is its
/// free-list link -- an object address, never an interior one.  That is proved
/// by `GC.Spec.Coalesce.coalesce_blue_fields_non_infix` and carried to the top
/// level by `GC.Spec.Correctness.gc_blue_fields_non_infix_gen`, so
/// `GC.Impl.collect_with_roots` and hence `GC.Gen.Impl.gen_gc` both return a
/// heap satisfying it: the invariant is closed across collections.
///
/// Across a *minor* collection it is re-established for free: the Cheney
/// machinery proves raw part 2 for blue objects, which
/// `blue_fields_non_infix_from_raw` turns straight back into this clause.
///
/// Free cells are already idealised by the surrounding model --- part 2 requires
/// every pointer-shaped word in them to resolve to an enumerated object, garbage
/// or not --- so this adds nothing to what a heap must already satisfy there.
///
/// The nursery side carries no corresponding restriction: a pointer into the
/// nursery may be interior.  Cheney's forwarding map records an entry for the
/// interior address as well as for the closure it points into
/// (`GC.Gen.CheneyBFS.fwd_covers_infix_fields` / `fwd_covers_infix_roots`), so
/// such a field is rewritten to the corresponding interior address in the
/// promoted copy.
