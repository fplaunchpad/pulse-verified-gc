/// GC.SPOT.MinorInfixHeap — a concrete nursery containing an OCaml interior
/// pointer
/// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// `GC.SPOT.MinorInfix` proves the major-to-nursery interior-pointer theorems,
/// but it does so over an *abstract* nursery, and its own non-vacuity note
/// records why: `minor_alloc_spec` writes only a header and leaves the body
/// zero, so no sequence of allocations can produce a nursery containing an
/// infix header, and the module therefore never exhibits a witness.  (That is a
/// limitation of the *spec-level* constructors, not of the collector: nursery
/// infix headers are supported, constrained by `minor_infix_wf` and interpreted
/// by `resolve_minor`.  They arrive the way OCaml puts them there --- as body
/// writes into an already-allocated `Closure_tag` block, `runtime/interp.c:575`
/// --- and the implementation's `GC.Gen.Impl.MinorHeap.minor_write` does
/// exactly that.)
///
/// This module is that witness.  The nursery is written out word by word ---
/// which `GC.Gen.MinorHeap`'s chain-walk defining equations now make possible
/// --- and laid out exactly as `CLOSUREREC` lays out a two-function mutually
/// recursive group small enough for the nursery
/// (`ocaml-4.14-unchanged/runtime/interp.c:575-610`):
///
///     byte  0 : header   wosize 3, tag 247 (Closure_tag)
///     byte  8 : field 0                              <- the closure, `a_minor`
///     byte 16 : field 1 = infix header, wosize 2, tag 249 (Infix_tag)
///     byte 24 : field 2                              <- the infix, `b_minor`
///     byte 32 : bump
///
/// The wosize of an infix header is not a size: it is the byte offset back to
/// the enclosing closure divided by eight, so `2` here means "the parent is 16
/// bytes below me", i.e. at byte 8.  `b_minor - 2 * 8 == a_minor`.
///
/// Note that field 1 of the closure --- the infix header word, 2297 --- is not
/// eight-aligned, so it is an OCaml immediate: neither
/// `GC.Spec.HeapGraph.is_pointer_field` nor `GC.Gen.Promote.is_minor_pointer`
/// accepts it, and the collector will not chase it.  That is what makes an
/// infix header safe to store in the middle of a scanned block.
