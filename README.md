# Verified OCaml Garbage Collector

This repository is a verified generational garbage-collector for OCaml
4.14, specified in [F*](https://fstar-lang.org/) and implemented in
[Pulse](https://fstar-lang.org/). It contains shared OCaml heap/object
infrastructure, a verified major-heap allocator, a bounded-stack mark-and-sweep
major collector, a generational collector with Cheney-style minor collection,
SPOT contract audits, KaRaMeL extraction to C, and an OCaml bytecode runtime
integration.

For the detailed design, proof architecture, public contracts, OCaml bridge
layout, benchmark table, and current verification boundary, see
[`DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md`](DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md).

## Quick local setup

The exact sequence CI runs in [`.github/workflows/verify.yml`](.github/workflows/verify.yml),
guaranteed to work end-to-end. Steps must run in this order

```bash
./setup.sh # setups up F*

fstar/bin/fstar.exe --version # check fstar version
# verify GC
make -j$(nproc) 

# verify SPOT
make -C spot -j$(nproc) 

# extract to C using Karamel
make extract

# generate a snapshot for integrating into OCaml runtime
make -C generational snapshot
# setup ocaml integration (stock ocaml and modified ocaml runtime with verified gc)
make -C generational/ocaml-integration setup

make -C generational/ocaml-integration/tests test # run smoke tests
make -C generational/ocaml-integration/tests benchmark # run benchmarks
```

## Current status

The active development is organized around dependency-scanned builds. The
top-level default verifies the active generational roots; `make generational`
checks the common, mark-and-sweep, generational, and SPOT sources. Excluding
bundled toolchain code and archived attempts, the active F*/Pulse tree contains
223 `.fst`/`.fsti` files and about 104k lines of source.

| Area | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared model and Pulse infrastructure | `common/` | OCaml headers, heap words, object layout, field traversal, graph/reachability, and shared Pulse heap/stack predicates. |
| Major collector and allocator | `mark-and-sweep/` | Verified free-list allocator, bounded-stack mark phase, and sweep/coalescing. Extracted as part of the generational snapshot, which runs this code for its major collections. |
| Generational collector | `generational/` | Verified minor heap, promotion, forwarding, remembered-slot/root rewriting, Cheney BFS, and composed `gen_gc`. |
| SPOT contract audits | `spot/` | Concrete three-object scenario calls the real `minor_collect_full` and `gen_gc` entry points and proves client-visible consequences. |
| OCaml integration | `generational/ocaml-integration/` | Extracted verified GC bridge for OCaml 4.14 bytecode, smoke tests, timing benchmarks, GC/RSS stats CSVs, heap calibration, and refreshed results. |

The latest default-heap verified-GC benchmark run reports a geometric-mean
slowdown of **1.45x** versus stock OCaml 4.14; a calibrated-heap pass using
stock-RSS-sized verified heaps reports **1.35x**. The full per-benchmark numbers
and discussion are in [`DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md`](DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md); the refreshed
CSV data lives under `generational/ocaml-integration/tests/results*/`.

## Build and verification

First run ./setup.sh to install a compatible F* binary release.

The repository uses a unified top-level `Makefile` with `fstar.exe --dep full`
for incremental dependency scheduling and parallel verification.

The top-level `Makefile` defaults to `FSTAR_HOME=$(pwd)/fstar`, so first ensure
that checkout contains a built `fstar/bin/fstar.exe` and `fstar/karamel/krml`.

```bash
make -j$(nproc)       # verify the active dependency roots
make generational     # verify common + mark-and-sweep + generational + SPOT
make extract          # verify and extract mark-and-sweep + generational C
make clean
```

Useful focused targets:

```bash
make common
make mark-and-sweep

cd spot && make -j    # local SPOT verification with its own .depend file
```

## Extraction, OCaml integration, and benchmarks

The generational collector is extracted through KaRaMeL and connected to OCaml's
bytecode runtime by `generational/ocaml-integration/verified_gc/alloc_gen.c`.
The current full-GC bridge uses a separate mutable `roots_for_gc` buffer and a
separate initially empty gray stack; verified `gen_gc` performs minor
collection, verified root darkening, and then major mark/sweep.

```bash
make extract

cd generational
make snapshot

cd ocaml-integration/verified_gc
make

cd ..
make setup
make test

cd tests
make benchmark
make bench-stats
make bench-min-heaps
```

See [`DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md`](DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md) for the exact `gen_gc` contract,
root/gray-stack protocol, verified boundary, and benchmark interpretation.

## Repository tour

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `common/` | Shared F*/Pulse definitions for OCaml-compatible heaps, objects, fields, graph construction, reachability, and low-level ownership. |
| `mark-and-sweep/` | Major-heap allocator and bounded-stack stop-the-world collector. |
| `generational/` | Minor heap, copying collection, promotion, forwarding maps, remembered slots, combined generational GC, extraction, and OCaml integration. |
| `spot/` | Small proof-oriented tests that audit whether the exported collector contracts are usable from concrete client scenarios. |
| `generational/snapshot/` | The checked-in extracted C. This is the single extraction target. |
| `research/docs/` and older planning files | Historical notes; prefer `DESIGN_AND_IMPL.md` for the current architecture. |
