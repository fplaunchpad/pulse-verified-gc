/// GC.Gen.CheneyCorrectness — End-to-end correctness for Cheney minor collector
/// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// This module states the main correctness theorem for the Cheney BFS minor
/// collector (cheney_collect_spec from GC.Gen.Cheney). The spec models:
///   1. BFS promotion of reachable minor objects into the major heap
///   2. Updating all major-heap pointer fields via the forwarding map
///   3. Rewriting program roots via the forwarding map
///   4. Resetting the minor heap (bump = 0)
///
/// The result type is minor_collect_result with fields:
///   mc_major  — the post-collection major heap (byte sequence)
///   mc_fp     — the post-collection free-list head
///   mc_minor  — the post-collection minor heap state
///   mc_roots  — the post-collection program roots
///   mc_fwd    — the forwarding map (minor addr → major addr, or 0 if not forwarded)
///
/// Properties proved:
///
/// 1. **Object survival**: all pre-existing major-heap objects survive
///    (promotion only appends into free-list nodes; never removes objects)
/// 2. **Heap well-formedness (part 1)**: every object's header+body fits
///    within the heap byte array after promotion
/// 3. **Minor reset**: minor heap bump pointer reset to 0
/// 4. **Root rewriting**: roots pointwise rewritten through the forwarding map
///    (minor-heap pointers replaced with their promoted major-heap addresses)
///
/// Properties 1-4 are UNCONDITIONAL — they hold even if the major heap
/// runs out of free-list space during promotion (partial promotion is safe).
///
/// 5. **BFS completeness** (CONDITIONAL on sufficient space): all minor objects
///    reachable from roots via minor_successors are forwarded.
///    This requires cheney_no_oom — that no promote_object call failed.
